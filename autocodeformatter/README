# install_format_scripts will install the auto formatting
# tool AStyle and a git pre-commit hook to validate changes 
# checked into the index are properly formatted before 
# allowing you to commit. To aid this process, the following 
# scripts are installed in ${DEV_DIR}/scripts:

# 1) checkCodeFormat -- grabs all files with changes in the
#    index and validates they are of the proper format by
#    calling formatFile.
# 2) formatFile -- Runs auto formatters on the file using the 
#    .astyle config file that was also installed
#    in the scripts dir.
# 3) format -- Runs auto formatters recursively on every 
#    *.cpp, *.h and *.hpp file in ${DEV_DIR}
